    For every node, a position is generated by choosing each of dim

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : xgi HyperGraph or list of nodes
        A position will be assigned to every node in HG.
    center : array-like or None
        Coordinate pair around which to center the layout.
    dim : int
        Dimension of layout.
    seed : int, RandomState instance or None  optional (default=None)
        Set the random state for deterministic node layouts.
        If int, `seed` is the seed used by the random number generator,
        if numpy.random.RandomState instance, `seed` is the random
        number generator,
        if None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
